title: Finally got access to GitHub Copilot!!
---

After months of being super excited to try it out, I finally got access yesterday to the GitHub Copilot technical preview!

A couple of months ago I was looking at my email every day just to see if I got invited and thankfully stopped doing that quicky because it took a while to get access. I was even looking at the GitHub subreddit and looking at Twitter to see how they were rolling out the access.

My first impression is that it's going to be great for learning new languages and frameworks. For example, when I tried it out I immediately tried to do something I have no experience with. I wanted to play something in text-to-speech using Python, and it led me instantly to a popular package I could use and the functions/structure I needed to start using it.

It's great!, and I can see why people find it scary, but it's definitely what the name suggests, a copilot. I see it as a huge time saver and a Stack Overflow/quick Google search replacement that's gonna shine in personal projects and self-learning.

It's also great to use OpenAI and GPT-3, all my experiences with them have been great as well, I've personally sunk hours into AI Dungeon previously, so to use it in a productivity space and seeing a bunch of different potential options for completion is super interesting.

I'm looking forward to starting a project with it, the experience so far has been completely positive.
