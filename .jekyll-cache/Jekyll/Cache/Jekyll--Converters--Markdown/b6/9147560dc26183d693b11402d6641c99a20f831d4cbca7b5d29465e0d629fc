I"*<h2 id="heyo-welcome-to-my-personal-blog">Heyo, welcome to my personal blog!</h2>
<p><br />
I’m Jackviel, a Computer Science major at the University of Central Florida.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a need to learn as much as I can, and that’s what this blog
will mostly be about and focused on.</p>

<p>What initially led me to start this blog was the fact that I was doing a deep dive into
video game hacking, an area that I’ve been interested in and have dabbled with since I was a kid. I found myself completely
enveloped in trying to learn as much as I can about all the different types of strategies and abstract concepts used in video game
hacking that I found myself wanting to share what I learned and the overall learning experience that I had.</p>

<p>So here we are!, this blog will focus on my learning experiences, my random thoughts on certain areas of technology, and maybe some
ramblings about personal stuff and random areas not necessarily about tech.</p>

<p>Hopefully you find some of it interesting or helpful! :)</p>
